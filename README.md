jquery.torturial
================

An advanced tutorial plugin for jQuery.

Version 0.0.5
-------------

Check out the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).


Getting started
---------------

Download both the latest version of [torturial.js](torturial.js) and [torturial.css](torturial.css), and load them into your project.

The plugin is known to work with the following versions, but it may be compatible with earlier versions.

Dependency: [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download/) 1.9+ or 2.0+.
Browser compatibility: Google Chrome 27+, Mozilla Firefox 20+, Internet Explorer 8+.

Please contact me if you have succesfully tested it on a previous version.

Examples
--------

You could take a look at my plugin before downloading it, I won't take it personally. Here are some [examples](http://nmussy.github.io/jquery.torturial/).

Features
--------

* Editables views, broke down into steps
* Each step is composed of popovers, and elements of the page can be brought back to the front
* Steps follow each other and are triggered by a delay and/or an `on()` event
* Eased navigation

Planned features
----------------

* Event triggered at key moments of the execution
* When the element to which the popover in attached to in animated, move the popover too
* Option: Making the delay visible to the user, perhaps with a circular progress widget
* Option: Pausing/Resuming the delay for the user
* Option: Giving control to the user on the flow of the steps (previous, next)

Usage
-----

### Methods

#### Initialization

```javascript
$('<div id="torturial"></div>').append('body').torturial({
[ // views
    {
       title: 'Usage',
       steps: [
           {
             popovers: [
                 {
                     id: 'popover-textarea',
                     text: 'Here\'s a text area',
                     attachTo: $('#foo'),
                     attachPos: 'left'
                 }
             ],
             changeOn: ['keypress', 'input', {foo: 'bar'}, function(e) {
                    if(e.which != 23)
                      return false;
                 }],
             delay: 5000,
             foreground: $('li')
           }
        ]
    },
    {
        title: 'Another view',
        steps: [
           {
              popovers: [
                 {
                    text: 'Another popover',
                    attachTo: $('#torturial-title'),
                    attachPos: 'bottom'
                 }
              ],
              delay: 300
           }
        ]
    }
],
{
   startingView: 1,
   startingStep: 0
}
]);
```

#### Visibility


```javascript
$('#torturial').torturial('show');

$('#torturial').torturial('hide');
```

#### Destruction

It first triggers a `.torturial('hide')`, no need to do it twice.

```javascript
$('#torturial').torturial('destroy');
```

### View

The tutorial will be composed of views, that the user will be able to navigate through using his mouse or keyboard. 
Each view acts as a placeholder for different steps.

* `steps` – The array containing the steps of the view.
* `title` – The view's title, selectable with `#turtorial-title`.

### Step

The step is the actual tutoring unit of the plugin.
They give out the information, and show the important elements of the web page.

* `popovers` – The array containing the popovers of the step, to be deleted when it is changed.
* `changeOn` – The array containing the options of the `on()` function of jQuery, please refer to the [API documentation](http://api.jquery.com/on/).
The step changing function will be called after the execution of the event handler. You can return `false` in order to prevent the next step to be loaded and keep your listener alive.
* `delay` – Value in milliseconds. __IMPORTANT__: A delay with the value `0` will result in an imediate change in the step, much like Javascript's [setTimeout](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp) and jQuery's [.delay](http://api.jquery.com/delay/).
* `foreground` – jQuery element or elements to be brought to the forground. Note that all their descendants will be advanced too.

### Popover

Text-containing bubbles that give out indication to the user.

* `text` – The string that the popover will contain.
* `id` – The string for the id attribute of the popover container.
* `attachTo` – jQuery element to which to popover will be attached to. It and its descendants will autoamatically be brought to the foreground.
* `attachPos` – The position of the popover relative to its attachment : `left`, `top`, `right` or `bottom`.
* `position` – Array of offset `top` and `left` positionning the popover absolutely.

### Options

* `startingView` – The index of the view that will be displayed at the creation of the torturial. `Default: 0`
* `startingStep` – The index of the step within the `startingView` to be first displayed at the creation of the torturial. `Default: 0`


### Keyboard shortcuts

* `Right arrow` : Next view (if any)
* `Left arrow` : Previous view (if any)
* `ESC` : Destroy the torturial
